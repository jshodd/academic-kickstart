I'm an engineer at heart who likes to build things, break things, and build
things that break things. I started my career working in a devops shop and carry
those mentalities with me as I venture further into the Security industry. I'm
currently a Security Engineer and work on anything ranging from building
automation and threat assessment tooling for over 200 AWS accounts to assisting
with PCI compliance penetration tests. I have a strong passion for Security and
have recently obtained my OSCP certification from Offensive Security. I'm always
looking to learn more about security in my free time, whether that be Capture
the Flags, Reverse Engineering, AppSec, etc. For a look at what I'm working on
check out my new [Wiki](https://wiki.jacobshodd.com). It may be a bit sparse at
the moment, but I'll be adding content as I work on new projects.
