I'm an engineer at heart who likes to build things, break things, and build
things that break other things. I started my career working in a devops shop and
carry those mentalities with me as I venture further into the Security industry.
I have a strong focus on AWS and cloud security, but I am working my way towards
the Offensive Security space.

This website is a place for me to document what I'm working on and hopefully
help others who are trying to learn.
